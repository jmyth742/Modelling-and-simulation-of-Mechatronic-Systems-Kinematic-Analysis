\section{Abstract}

The quality of the driving simulator depends on its ability to mimic actual driving behaviour in a vehicle. The driver will feel accelerations and rotations that will give him the impression to be in a vehicle. The kinematic model is the basis for the user experience of the driver. The following report explains the generation of the kinematic model and it's implementation in Maple. It analyses different kinematic behaviours, with 2 out of 3 fixed degrees of freedom. Finally based on the findings we decided to chose one of the three geometries.
